When do you think part 2 could be done? Or at least the calendar function?

part 2 will contain the employee ui and the customer ui ,with the appointment function. I should tell you that it might not be possible to see appointment in that small calender, so I will provide a different section which will act as a calendar and will help in adding or viewing appointments in a calendar fashion

If you want, we could divide like this: Part 2, possible for admin to add appointments in the calendar and view calendar , assign appointments to customer # and employee. Then part 3 we can do the UI for customer & employee?

k

Mar 17, 6:50 PM
One more thing I would like to know - how will admin calculate hours of work for a particular employee? I mean Admin gives EmpA appointment with CustA and Cust2 for 1 hour each, so should we assume that he has worked for 2 hours here? or is there any other way for that?

k

Mar 17, 6:52 PM
and when will you need the part 2?? I mean I will say a MAXIMUM of 12 days for this one, but if everything is normal, then I can complete it in a week or even less

k

Mar 17, 6:52 PM
but you should still consider the maximum time,just in case

I would like the part 2 asap, as long as you feel you can do it.. you can start whenever, so its up to you.

So, my colleague wanted to set hours per customer. So in the customer field (where you edit #123 for example) should have a field of: Hours. Admin should be able to set this "Hours" to amount of hours they always spend at this customer. Because they are always at the customer for same amount of time.

So if i edit "Customer A" admin should be able to set decided amount of hours on Customer A, meaning everything Customer A shows in scheduel, it should show the amount of hours.

But amount of hours should be able to be changed seperately at certain ocations, because it happens VERY rarely that they spend 0.5 hours more or 0.5 hours less at Customer A. Then admin should be able to change this seperately. But Customer A should always by standard be set to "Fixed amount of hours"

Yes, totals of hours worked each months should be updated real time if possible on dashboard maybe? And we also need to calculate the costs.. Because each hour cost a certain amount. Hourly charge

Mar 17, 7:21 PM

This would be the best: Add a field on each customer, hourly cost: and it should be set to 350 as standard, but IF admin want to change for certain customer, he can just go to that customer and change it

So admin can see : Total of hours worked per month, total costs each month, profit, etc

k

Mar 17, 7:22 PM
yes it can be calculated, but how can the data of 10 employees be shown on the main dashboard? I mean, I can show it, it won't be a problem, but won't it look a bit cramped?

k

Mar 17, 7:22 PM
and how will the profit be calculate?

Dashboard can show: total profits and total hours. But then maybe have another tab, that is called: Summary

Mar 17, 7:25 PM
yeah sure, and each emplyees detais ...or maybe another section..will contain these details of which employee worked for how many hours and what is his cost..like that

So total of income should be: Hourly cost X amount of working hours

default hourly price for customer will be 350, which can be changed by admin? and is there default hourly income for the employee as well?

Yes, tehre should be for employee as well, but can we do this further ahead? I have to check with my colleague in order to give you a good answer there, becuase he wants it in a certain way.. But we can start with total of income, total of working hours,

Mar 17, 7:30 PM

There should be like 4-5 fields of different fields of Totals, (total working hours, total costs, total income, etc) and profit is gonna be calculated in a specific way. I believe we can take this in part 3. (The profit and last Total steps).

Because in Sweden we have a way for businesses working with this type of job, that the customer gets 50% price off, this is paid by the government instead. Thats why we have to calculate it in another way. But this we can take as last step

it won't work that way actually, i mean if there was something like swedish calendar api..then I could have got the holiday data from there..without any manual updation, but that type of api does not exist, so adding holidays would be a bit difficult, but can be added in a similar way as everything is being added now

1 thing that we would need in creating customer, is a tick box or drop down, that lets you choose if the customer is gonna have bi -weekly or once a month appointment. Because same employee is usually at the same customer 1 or 2 times each month. So if you can have a thing in the customer options that let you decide this, then it would automatically show for that employee on the same date every month

So if Employee1 is gonna clean Kunaldeys house, 2 times every month, it should be a box that the admin can fill in what date every month for the rest of the coming months.
